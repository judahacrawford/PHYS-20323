\begin{enumerate}
\item (4 points) Which of these stars will produce a planetary nebula.
\\
\item (4 points) Elements heavier than Carbon will be produced in which stars.
\end{enumerate}
\item An electron is found to be in the spin state (in the z-basis): 
$\chi$ = A $\begin{pmatrix} 3 \textit{i} \\4 \end{pmatrix}$

\begin{enumerate}
    \item (5 points) Determine the possible values of A such that the state is normalized.
    \\
    \item (5 points) Find the expectation values of the operators {\color{red}$S_{x}$}, {\color{purple}$S_{y}$}, {\color{orange}$S_{z}$} and $\vec{S}^2$.\\
    
    

\end{enumerate}
The matrix representations in the z-basis for the components of electron spin operators are given by:\\

{\color{red}\bf{$S_{x}$} = $\frac{\hbar}{2}\begin{pmatrix} 0&1\\1&0\end{pmatrix}$}
{\color{purple};\hspace{1cm}\bf{$S_{y}$} = $\frac{\hbar}{2}\begin{pmatrix} 0&-\textit{i}\\\textit{i}&0\end{pmatrix}$}
{\color{orange};\hspace{1cm}\bf{$S_{z}$} = $\frac{\hbar}{2}\begin{pmatrix} 1&0\\0&-1\end{pmatrix}$}


\item The average electrostatic field in the earthâ€™s atmosphere in fair weather is approximately given:


\begin{equation}
\vec{E} = E_{0}(Ae^{-\alpha z}+Be^{-\beta z})\hat{z}, 
\end{equation}

where A, B, $\alpha$, $\beta$ are positive constants and z is the height above the (locally flat) earth surface.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item (5 points) Find the average charge density in the atmosphere as a function of height\\
    \item (5 points) Find the electric potential as a function height above the earth.
\end{enumerate}

\end{enumerate}
